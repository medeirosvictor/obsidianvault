**Race Name:** Godkin or Astral Folk
---
**Origins and Nature:**  
The Godkin, also known as Astral Folk, are ascended souls intricately connected to the Astral Plane. They exist as spectral entities in the Astral Plane, capable of assuming any form or appearance of their choosing. Their ethereal existence renders them immortal beings, unaffected by the passage of time.  
**Immortality and Reincarnation:**  
Their tie to the Astral Plane grants them everlasting life, ensuring their continuous presence throughout ages. Upon mortal death, they retain a significant portion of their memories and experiences. Returning to the Astral Plane, they deliberate whether to linger there for a time or reincarnate into a new form on different planes. This cycle of reincarnation is central to their culture, as they perceive life's challenges as opportunities for growth and enlightenment.  
**Cultural Beliefs and Teachings:**  
Embedded within their culture is a profound belief in the transference of wisdom. The Godkin regard themselves as both students and teachers, seeking to incarnate on diverse planes to experience and impart knowledge. They view this as a means to enrich their souls and serve as guides, nurturing growth and understanding among other beings.  
**Role in Astral Affairs:**  
In times of astral conflict or when the mantle of gods needs succession, the Godkin emerge as potential candidates to assume these divine roles. They are seen as custodians of balance and knowledge, stepping forward to safeguard cosmic equilibrium when malevolent forces threaten the fabric of existence.  
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. The Godkin are attuned to the wisdom of the cosmos and possess a natural charm from their experiences across planes.
**Age:** Godkin, as ascended beings, cease to age once they ascend. They are effectively immortal and do not die from old age.
**Alignment:** Godkin tend toward a neutral alignment, reflecting their pursuit of cosmic balance and enlightenment. However, individual Godkin can vary widely in alignment based on their experiences and personal philosophies.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
**Spectral Form:** As an action, you can assume a spectral form for up to 1 minute. In this form, you gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
**Astral Connection:** You have proficiency in the Arcana skill, reflecting your innate connection to the astral and other planes.
**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial. Additionally, due to your connection to the astral plane, you can telepathically communicate with any creature within 30 feet that understands a language.

1. _Wisdomtouched:_ You gain proficiency in the Insight skill. Your spectral form ability lasts for an additional minute before requiring a rest.
2. _Charismawalker:_ You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Once per long rest, you can cast the Charm Person spell (using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for this spell).
From the chaos and order of the existence:
1. **Celestial Alignment:** During rare alignments of celestial bodies or significant cosmic events, a convergence of ethereal energies occurs. This cosmic event creates a unique opportunity for the formation of new Godkin souls.
2. **Soulweaving Ritual:** Skilled and revered Godkin known as Soulweavers gather during these celestial alignments in sanctified astral sanctuaries. They possess the knowledge and mastery of intricate rituals that blend their wisdom, essence, and astral energies to shape new souls.
3. **Ascendance of Mortal Souls:** Alongside the Soulweavers, esteemed mortal souls from various planes - those who have led lives marked by exceptional goodness, virtue, and valor - are invited into the sanctuaries. Through a sacred ritual, these souls willingly offer a portion of their essence to contribute to the creation of new Godkin.
4. **Rebirth as Astralfolk:** Through the Soulweaving ritual, the essence of these honored mortal souls merges with the harmonized astral forces, undergoing a transformation. As the new Godkin souls emerge, these ascended mortal souls are reborn as Astralfolk, retaining memories and virtues from their past lives while transcending into an existence as enlightened beings.
5. **Birth of New Godkin:** As the cosmic convergence reaches its culmination, newly formed Godkin souls and reborn Astralfolk emerge, each carrying fragments of the wisdom and experiences of their past lives. The Godkin embody the teachings and virtues of their predecessors, while the Astralfolk continue their journey, committed to perpetuating goodness and enlightenment across existence.
