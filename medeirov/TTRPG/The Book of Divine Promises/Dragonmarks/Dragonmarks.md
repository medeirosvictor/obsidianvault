**Dragonmarks and Alma Matter:**
The Astral Folk, in their quest for enlightenment, acquired a profound understanding of The Weave, the underlying fabric of magic in the multiverse. They gained this knowledge through the tutelage of ancient astral colossal dragons, beings revered for their immense wisdom and mastery over magic. These colossal dragons imparted the secrets of manipulating The Weave through a unique alphabet/language system known as "dragonmarks."
**Dragonmarks of Power:**  
These dragonmarks, a series of arcane symbols and glyphs, encode powerful magical knowledge, allowing those who understand them to manipulate The Weave with precision and finesse. The marks, when properly understood and harnessed, grant access to formidable magical abilities across various schools of magic.  
**Alma Matter and the Rogue Godkin's Agenda:**  
Unbeknownst to many, a rogue Godkin, named Elyrian Shadowweaver, has nefarious intentions. Utilizing the knowledge of dragonmarks, Elyrian has taken it upon himself to spread this arcane language among beings across the planes. This group, calling themselves Alma Matter, comprises individuals who have been taught these marks by Elyrian.  
**The Sinister Agenda:**  
Under the guise of enlightenment and freedom from the gods' influence, Alma Matter follows Elyrian's teachings, believing that by eradicating the gods and replacing them with Godkin, they can establish a utopia free from divine intervention and control.  
**Chaos and Discord:**  
As Alma Matter's influence spreads, chaos ensues across the planes. Some individuals, drawn by the promise of freedom from divine constraints, eagerly join the cause. Others, aware of the catastrophic implications of such a plan, seek to thwart Alma Matter's intentions, fearing the destabilization of the cosmic balance.  
**Dragonmarks as Birthmarks:**
Intriguingly, scattered across the material plane, a rare phenomenon occurs where individuals are born bearing peculiar birthmarks resembling the enigmatic dragonmarks taught by the Astral Folk. These birthmarks, etched on the skin in intricate patterns, are recognized as arcane symbols reminiscent of the dragonmarks of power.
**Mysterious Origins:**  
The appearance of these dragonmark-like birthmarks perplexes scholars and mystics alike. The origin of these marks remains shrouded in mystery, sparking various theories among different cultures and societies. Some believe it signifies a divine blessing, while others see it as a curse or omen.  
**Unexplained Connection:**  
Individuals born with these birthmarks often display latent magical talents or heightened sensitivity to The Weave. They might unknowingly manifest minor magical abilities or exhibit an innate understanding of certain magical principles without formal training.  
**Alma Matter's Interest:**  
Alma Matter, led by the rogue Godkin Elyrian Shadowweaver, takes a keen interest in these individuals bearing dragonmark-like birthmarks. They view them as potential recruits in their mission to spread knowledge of the dragonmarks and further their agenda to overthrow the gods.  
**Societal Reactions:**  
Societies and factions across the material plane react differently to those with dragonmark-like birthmarks. Some revere them as chosen ones, while others fear and ostracize them, perceiving them as threats or harbingers of impending chaos.  
**Player Interaction:**  
Player characters might encounter NPCs with these birthmarks, facing dilemmas regarding their origins, potential, and the significance of their innate connection to the dragonmarks. The characters could become entangled in conflicts or quests linked to these individuals' destinies.
