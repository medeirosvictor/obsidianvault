**The Mirror of Pergolago**Â - A central feature of the city is the Mirror of Pergolago, a large, tranquil lake that rests within a cavernous hollow at the heart of the asteroid. Despite the city's bustling activity, the lake is eerily still, its surface reflecting the bioluminescent fungi and the soft glow of astral minerals embedded in the cavern walls, creating a mesmerizing, otherworldly effect.
The lake is not only a source of fresh water for the city's inhabitants but also a sacred site for many. It is said that the waters of the Mirror have unusual properties, occasionally displaying visions of other planes or past events to those who gaze into its depths. The lake is surrounded by a ring of smooth stone, worn by countless visitors who come to meditate, seek insight, or simply bask in the lake's serene beauty.
Local legend claims that the lake is the anchor that keeps the asteroid city from drifting aimlessly through the Astral Plane. Some believe that the lake is a nexus of ley lines, while others whisper that an ancient entity slumbers beneath its surface, dreaming the city into existence.
The Mirror of Pergolago is a place of respite and reflection but also holds potential for adventure. It could be a meeting point for secretive exchanges, a source of mystical revelations, or even the entrance to a hidden underwater passage leading to lost caverns and the city's underbelly.

The underbelly of pergolago
Um templo inverso, a entrada se encontra embaixo do lago. Facil acesso e publica; na parte debaixo entretanto todos os tipos de birutas se encontram. Dificil dizer quem parece ser de fato sao.
Oris o Vidente Sob o lago eh aquele que por um bom pagamento consegue rastrear aqueles que estao no Bazzar, seus servicos incluem inclusive o tracking de racas e suas quantidades e para aqueles com certa influence ate mesmo onde se encontram no asteroide de forma geral. E ate mesmo quem ja esteve no asteroide
Ele consegue se comunicar de forma bastante rudimentar com a pedra-viva; Inserindo tablets de comunicacao e recebendo algumas reclamacoes; A criatura tem uma certa trajetoria segura e eh imune aos efeitos dos time warps do plano astral;
![[Untitled 2 4.png|Untitled 2 4.png]]
Suas diretrizes sao simples, um chamado espiritual o leva eventualmente ate uma dessas criaturas, um chamado especial que os trazem de qualquer outro plano para o encontro de um dos asteroides. Sempre estao preparados nao importa de onde veem ou o quanto sabem;
Aqui os fanaticos de 1 reinam; Muitos pregando a destruicao do panteao e outros validando a transferencia dos dominios dos dragoes astrais para o Chaos e Order. Os mais stoics sao os que acreditam apenas no C&O, estes sao hippies da regiao que utilizam de shimmer astral para ter um high, dice rollers e gamblers que tomam riscos inadequados em busca de provar que sao enviados de um dos lados da moeda. Nao acreditam necessariamente em lado bom e lado ruim, acreditam que a balanca deve sempre existir e que as vezes devem existir pecadores.
