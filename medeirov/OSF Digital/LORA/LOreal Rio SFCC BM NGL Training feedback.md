Hello everyone!
I hope this email finds you all well. I wanted to take a moment to share my insights and feedback on the recent training I conducted for the LORA/NGL Brazil team. Overall, the training experience was positive, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my knowledge and expertise.
Here are some key points I observed during the training:
1. While we had a good attendance both in person and online, I noticed that most of the participants were not merchandisers or webmasters. As a result, some of the content provided during the training might have been more hands-on and detailed than necessary for their roles.
2. The team responded well to the showcase of NGL, and it was evident that they now have a better understanding of what SFCC and NGL are capable of. However, this also highlighted the need for establishing clear processes and governance to maximize the potential of the system effectively.
3. The training allowed for open questions, but many of them were "ticket-specific." It became apparent that the team lacks support for merchandising efforts, and I commend Andre de Carvalho for stepping up to help, despite not being a merchandiser himself.
4. I took some questions and tickets home to assist further, but it's evident that the team needs ongoing support from someone with deeper technical knowledge on SFCC and NGL to unblock their tickets effectively.Due to the need to address individual cases, I had to rush through some parts of the training. With more time, I could have provided additional practical examples to enhance their understanding.
5. While the overall participation and interest were commendable, I observed that the allocated training time was not always respected. Some team members had to leave the room or attend to urgent matters within their brands. This might indicate a need for improved organizational structure within the BR teams, especially when handling the current demands of large brands like ours, since the training is there to possibly help them with those urgent matters.
In conclusion, the training provided valuable insights to the Brazil team, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to their growth. Moving forward, we can consider exploring ways to enhance their proficiency with SFCC and NGL without necessarily implying additional training costs. One potential approach could involve fostering knowledge-sharing sessions among the team members or establishing a mentorship program, allowing them to learn from experienced colleagues within the organization.
Furthermore, I believe it would be beneficial to assess the feasibility of providing dedicated technical support for the Brazil team. Having someone with specialized knowledge on SFCC and NGL readily available to assist with ticket resolution and merchandising efforts could significantly boost their productivity and confidence in handling the system.
If you have any specific questions or would like further details about the training, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Best regards,
Victor Medeiros
